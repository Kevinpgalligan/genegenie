Work-in-progress website generator for Gramps family trees.

This will be very specific to how I use the Gramps software, and the conventions I've adopted. However, it might be useful as a basis for someone who wants to develop their own Gramps-related software.

### Requirements
* Gramps 5.1 (haven't tested with other versions).
* The Gramps Python package should be on your Python path. I achieved this by installing Gramps through my Ubuntu package manager: `apt install gramps`.
* Flask (Python web server... I will eventually freeze the requirements in a requirements.txt).
