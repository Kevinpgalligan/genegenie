Work-in-progress website generator for Gramps family trees.

Requirements:

* Gramps 5.1 (haven't tested with other versions).
* The Gramps Python package should be on your Python path. I achieved this by installing Gramps through my Ubuntu package manager: `apt install gramps`.
* Flask (Python web server... I will eventually freeze the requirements in a requirements.txt).
